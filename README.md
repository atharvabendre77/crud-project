# crud-project
This project is a simple web application developed using Django, a high-level Python web framework, to demonstrate CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. 
Certainly! Your CRUD project in Django is a web application that enables users to perform four basic operations on student records: Create, Read, Update, and Delete. It likely includes functionalities like adding new student details to the database, displaying existing student records, editing or updating student information, and removing student entries from the database. The project demonstrates the use of Django's Class-Based Views to handle these operations efficiently, providing a structured and organized way to manage student data. Overall, the project serves as a practical exercise to practice Django development skills and understand how to build dynamic web applications with user interaction.
